# LLM Selection Decision

| Decision Factor | My Choice | Reason |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Which LLM followed my prompt structure most faithfully? | ChatGPT | Returned output in the exact format requested |
| Which LLM was most technically accurate (least hallucination)? | ChatGPT | Direct, point-by-point responses without fabricated details |
| Which LLM's output was most readable and well-organized? | Claude | Clearest formatting and most scannable structure |
| Which LLM handled the "honesty check" best? | Gemini | Correctly flagged layers where LLMs were not meaningfully used |

**Selected LLM for final tool: ChatGPT**

**Why:** ChatGPT consistently prioritized clarity over verbosity — it answered the prompt directly, structured output logically, and avoided padding responses with unnecessary context. Across technical layers, it stayed accurate without overstating applicability, making it the most reliable choice for this type of structured teardown task.
